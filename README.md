<img  style="float: right;" src="./ai-face.png" width="300px">
CAI (Command Line Artificial Intelligence) is a tool that uses the power of artificial intelligence and ChatGPT API to provide a natural language interface to the command line. With CAI, users can interact with the command line in a more intuitive way by asking questions and receiving answers in natural language.
<br><br>
CAI is built on top of ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI that is capable of understanding natural language and generating human-like responses. When a user types a command or asks a question in natural language, CAI uses ChatGPT to interpret the input and generate a response.
<br><br>
The benefits of using CAI include increased productivity and efficiency, as users can interact with the command line more quickly and easily. Additionally, CAI can help users who are not familiar with the command line to learn and use it more effectively.
<br><br>
Overall, CAI represents a powerful combination of artificial intelligence and command line technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and technology.
